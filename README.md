# About Fast Client Archive

_Some clients in this archive are worth checking out, even if they may look bad at the beginning. They can become really good when paired with another client, as they bring some **special features** that strong clients lack._ The names of these clients are **seppuku**, **sushi**, **madcat 3.0**, **lemon**... <br>
